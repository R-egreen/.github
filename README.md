# Data analytics team

Welcome! 

This organization stores main projects developed by the data analytics team. 


Good practices adapted by our team

- repositories should be self-contained and whenever is possible use relative paths to read and write data
- always use `git pull` and `git push` to avoid conflicts
- for repositories with branches (e.g. `cf_refor`), work on branch `dev` and keep the `main` updated from time to time
- always create a README.md explaining the context of the project
- specify which libraries and data are needed for each project
- for collective commits use:
